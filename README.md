# Ticket Booking
Hi ðŸ‘‹,

In this project, I made a ticket reservation application in Visual Basic .NET using Microsoft Forms on Visual Studio. <br>


There is an home page that welcomes the user<br><br>

About page with information about the movie theater (an auditorium in this project)<br><br>

A ticket purchase page where you can select an event, time and seat.<br><br>

Also on the ticket purchase page; Seat selection is not made without selecting the event and time, and if the user tries to buy no or more than two tickets, this action is blocked.<br><br>

Thank you for reviewing my project and reading this far.<br>
I would be very happy if you follow me for motivation. If you don't, I won't even know you exist, so do it. See you soon.
